PhaserHaxe
==========

Haxe bindings for the JavaScript library Phaser (http://www.photonstorm.com/phaser)

These extern classes were written manually mostly, so there probably are bugs, but also a lot of things normally going wrong in automated processes were prevented.

Missing stuff:
- the advanced physics ("physics/advanced/p2.js")
- the PIXI library within Phaser ("pixi/Pixi.js")
