PhaserHaxe
==========

Haxe bindings for the JavaScript library Phaser (http://www.photonstorm.com/phaser)

Current version 1.1.4

These extern classes were written manually mostly, so there probably are bugs, but also a lot of things normally going wrong in automated processes were prevented.

Missing stuff:
- the PIXI library within Phaser ("pixi/Pixi.js")
